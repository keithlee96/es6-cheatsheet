## Initalization and Execution

There are 2 stages that Javascript code goes through when it is run. Initalization and execution. When code inside of a specific scope (Any `{}` block), it goes through both stages sequentially. This could be a recursive process, as during execution of a block of code, another initalization might occur for nested code.

#### Initalization

When code inside a `{}` is run, JavaScript will perform memory allocation. Variables will be initalized to `undefined` until they hit a line of code that sets that variable's value.

#### Execution

The code is executed. Variables within a closure (`{}`) will have their references determine based on what each variable is set to in it's closest lexical scope. Eg; if a variable is not explicitly defined in this scope, we check it's outerscope for any definitions of that same variable.

Any variable defined with var within a nested block of code will be initalized based on it's function scope instead of it's lexical scope. This can lead to unexpected behaviour with regards to scoping, as highlighted here:

```javascript
{
    const a = 5;
    {
        // a is not explicitly defined in this scope. Hence, this references a in the outer scope
        console.log(a);
        // logs 5
    }
}

{
    const a = 5;
    {
        // Scope B
        // Due to the let statement within Scope B, when Scope B is initalized, memory for variable a is assigned and set to undefined
        console.log(a); 
        // logs undefined
        let a = 3;
    }
}

{
    // Scope A
    const a = 5;
    {
        // Scope B
        // The let statement in Scope C does not initalize the memory for nested variable a until scope C is initalized
        // Hence, this references a in the outer scope
        console.log(a); 
        // logs 5
        {
            // Scope C            
            // Same concept as before, when Scope C is initalized, memory for variable a is assigned and set to undefined
            console.log(a);
            // logs undefined
            let a = 3;
        }
    }
}

{
    // Scope A
    const a = 5;
    {
        // Scope B
        // Due to the var (not let) statement in scope C, when scope B is initalized, memory for variable a is assigned and set to undefined
        console.log(a); 
        // logs undefined
        {
            // Scope C
            var a = 3;
        }
    }
}

```


### Prototypal inheritance

JavaScript makes use of Prototypal inheritance, rather than Classical inheritance.

When searching for Object attributes, it checks if they are on the current object. If not, they check it's prototype.
If it's not there, JavaScript keeps going up the prototype chain

### `this` value

When a function is called, `this` is set to the value of the object that this function was an attribute of. This is set to be the value of the object this executable code is a part of.

    `func.call(thisValue, ...args)` - set this to thisValue and call the function with args
    `func.bind(thisValue)` - set this to thisValue (The first call of bind takes precedence)

Arrow functions set the value of `this` to match the outer lexical value of `this` and cannot be changed using `.call()` or `.bind()`

## Basic logic constructs

### If-else
```javascript
if(a === 1){
    // code
}else{
    // code
}
```
### while
```javascript
while(condition){
  // code
  break // Break out of the loop and continue code execution
  continue // Go back to the condition
}
```
### loops
#### Standard loop - (initalize, condition, increment)
```javascript
for(let i = 0; i<10; i++){
  // code executes 10 times
}
```
> **Note**:
  When you have a loop with a `let i` and the code inside updates the value of `i`, the time `i` is updated will only sometimes affect the value of `i` in future iterations.
  when `i` is updated before the loop ends, the value of future iterations of `i` will be affected.
  When `i` is updated after the loop ends, that does not affect future iteration values of `i`.

#### for-of
for-of will use an object specific iterator. This works on any object with the `Symbol.iterator` generator function defined or is itself a generator function. (Eg; this works on Arrays, since they have a defined `Symbol.iterator` generator function). (Reccomended for most JavaScript objects)

```javascript
obj[Symbol.iterator] = generatorFunction

for(let i of obj){
    // Iterate over this object's iterables
    // Throws an error if this object has no iterator
}
```

#### for-in

For-in returns the enumerable attribute names of an object. This includes any properties defined up the prototype chain too.

```javascript
for(let i in obj){
    attribute = obj[i]
    // more code
}
```

```javascript
obj= {
  "a": 'aa',
  "b":'bb'
}

obj.__proto__ = {
  "c":'cc'
}

for (let o in obj) {
  console.log(foo[o]);
  // logs 'aa','bb','cc'
}
```
## var versus let / const

var - function scoped

let - lexically scoped (nearest enclosing {})

const - lexically scoped and immutable (The refernce is immutable, the object itself can be modified)

Implicit definitions - Dangerous - A variable refernced, but not explictly defined anywhere will become part of the global execution scope.

> Besides `var`, we now have access to two new identifiers for storing values
â€”`let` and `const`. Unlike `var`, `let` and `const` statements are not hoisted
to the top of their enclosing scope.

An example of using `var`:

```javascript
var snack = 'Meow Mix';

function getFood(food) {
    if (food) {
        var snack = 'Friskies';
        return snack;
    }
    return snack;
}

getFood(false); // undefined
```

However, observe what happens when we replace `var` using `let`:

```javascript
let snack = 'Meow Mix';

function getFood(food) {
    if (food) {
        let snack = 'Friskies';
        return snack;
    }
    return snack;
}

getFood(false); // 'Meow Mix'
```

This change in behavior highlights that we need to be careful when refactoring
legacy code which uses `var`. Blindly replacing instances of `var` with `let`
may lead to unexpected behavior.

> **Note**: `let` and `const` are block scoped. Therefore, referencing
block-scoped identifiers before they are defined will produce
a `ReferenceError`.

```javascript
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined

let x = 'hi';
```

> **Best Practice**: Leave `var` declarations inside of legacy code to denote
that it needs to be carefully refactored. When working on a new codebase, use
`let` for variables that will change their value over time, and `const` for
variables which cannot be reassigned.

## Replacing IIFEs with Blocks

> A common use of **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions** is to enclose
values within its scope. In ES6, we now have the ability to create block-based
scopes and therefore are not limited purely to function-based scope.

```javascript
(function () {
    var food = 'Meow Mix';
}());

console.log(food); // Reference Error
```

Using ES6 Blocks:

```javascript
{
    let food = 'Meow Mix';
};

console.log(food); // Reference Error
```

## Arrow Functions

Often times we have nested functions in which we would like to preserve the
context of `this` from its lexical scope. An example is shown below:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {
    return arr.map(function (character) {
        return this.name + character; // Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
    });
};
```

One common solution to this problem is to store the context of `this` using
a variable:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {
    var that = this; // Store the context of this
    return arr.map(function (character) {
        return that.name + character;
    });
};
```

We can also pass in the proper context of `this`:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {
    return arr.map(function (character) {
        return this.name + character;
    }, this);
};
```

As well as bind the context:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {
    return arr.map(function (character) {
        return this.name + character;
    }.bind(this));
};
```

Using **Arrow Functions**, the lexical value of `this` isn't shadowed and we
can re-write the above as shown:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.prefixName = function (arr) {
    return arr.map(character => this.name + character);
};
```

> **Best Practice**: Use **Arrow Functions** whenever you need to preserve the
lexical value of `this`.

Arrow Functions are also more concise when used in function expressions which
simply return a value:

```javascript
var squares = arr.map(function (x) { return x * x }); // Function Expression
```

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squares = arr.map(x => x * x); // Arrow Function for terser implementation
```

> **Best Practice**: Use **Arrow Functions** in place of function expressions
when possible.

## Strings

With ES6, the standard library has grown immensely. Along with these changes
are new methods which can be used on strings, such as `.includes()` and
`.repeat()`.

### .includes( )

```javascript
var string = 'food';
var substring = 'foo';

console.log(string.indexOf(substring) > -1);
```

Instead of checking for a return value `> -1` to denote string containment,
we can simply use `.includes()` which will return a boolean:

```javascript
const string = 'food';
const substring = 'foo';

console.log(string.includes(substring)); // true
```

### .repeat( )

```javascript
function repeat(string, count) {
    var strings = [];
    while(strings.length < count) {
        strings.push(string);
    }
    return strings.join('');
}
```

In ES6, we now have access to a terser implementation:

```javascript
// String.repeat(numberOfRepetitions)
'meow'.repeat(3); // 'meowmeowmeow'
```

### Template Literals

Using **Template Literals**, we can now construct strings that have special
characters in them without needing to escape them explicitly.

```javascript
var text = "This string contains \"double quotes\" which are escaped.";
```

```javascript
let text = `This string contains "double quotes" which don't need to be escaped anymore.`;
```

**Template Literals** also support interpolation, which makes the task of
concatenating strings and values:

```javascript
var name = 'Tiger';
var age = 13;

console.log('My cat is named ' + name + ' and is ' + age + ' years old.');
```

Much simpler:

```javascript
const name = 'Tiger';
const age = 13;

console.log(`My cat is named ${name} and is ${age} years old.`);
```

In ES5, we handled new lines as follows:

```javascript
var text = (
    'cat\n' +
    'dog\n' +
    'nickelodeon'
);
```

Or:

```javascript
var text = [
    'cat',
    'dog',
    'nickelodeon'
].join('\n');
```

**Template Literals** will preserve new lines for us without having to
explicitly place them in:

```javascript
let text = ( `cat
dog
nickelodeon`
);
```

**Template Literals** can accept expressions, as well:

```javascript
let today = new Date();
let text = `The time and date is ${today.toLocaleString()}`;
```

## Destructuring

Destructuring allows us to extract values from arrays and objects (even deeply
nested) and store them in variables with a more convenient syntax.

Destructured assignments are simultaneous, allowing you to write clean code.

Swapping variables:
```javascript
[a,b]=[b,a]
```

### Destructuring Arrays

```javascript
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
var a = arr[0];
var b = arr[1];
var c = arr[2];
var d = arr[3];
```

```javascript
let [a, b, c, d] = [1, 2, 3, 4];

console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 2
```

### Destructuring Objects

```javascript
var luke = { occupation: 'jedi', father: 'anakin' };
var occupation = luke.occupation; // 'jedi'
var father = luke.father; // 'anakin'
```

```javascript
let luke = { occupation: 'jedi', father: 'anakin' };
let {occupation, father='anakin'} = luke;

console.log(occupation); // 'jedi'
console.log(father); // 'anakin'
```

### Default assignments
```javascript
let luke = { occupation: 'jedi' };
// If father is not defined in luke, father is set to anakin
let {occupation, father = 'anakin'} = luke;

console.log(occupation); // 'jedi'
console.log(father); // 'anakin'
```

Note: Destructured assignments are particularly useful for use as function parameters

## Modules

Prior to ES6, we used libraries such as [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
to create modules on the client-side, and [require](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_require_id)
in **Node.js**. With ES6, we can now directly use modules of all types
(AMD and CommonJS).

### Exporting in CommonJS

```javascript
module.exports = 1;
module.exports = { foo: 'bar' };
module.exports = ['foo', 'bar'];
module.exports = function bar () {};
```

### Exporting in ES6

With ES6, we have various flavors of exporting. We can perform
**Named Exports**:

```javascript
export let name = 'David';
export let age  = 25;â€‹â€‹
```

As well as **exporting a list** of objects:

```javascript
function sumTwo(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function sumThree(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

export { sumTwo, sumThree };
```

We can also export functions, objects and values (etc.) simply by using the `export` keyword:

```javascript
export function sumTwo(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

export function sumThree(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}
```

And lastly, we can **export default bindings**:

```javascript
function sumTwo(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function sumThree(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

let api = {
    sumTwo,
    sumThree
};

export default api;

/* Which is the same as
 * export { api as default };
 */
```

> **Best Practices**: Always use the `export default` method at **the end** of
the module. It makes it clear what is being exported, and saves time by having
to figure out what name a value was exported as. More so, the common practice
in CommonJS modules is to export a single value or object. By sticking to this
paradigm, we make our code easily readable and allow ourselves to interpolate
between CommonJS and ES6 modules.

### Importing in ES6

By default, import will import the object named "default", which is set by the exporting program
`export default <<blah>>`;

ES6 provides us with various flavors of importing. We can import an entire file:

```javascript
import 'underscore';
```

> It is important to note that simply **importing an entire file will execute
all code at the top level of that file**.

Similar to Python, we have named imports:

```javascript
import { sumTwo, sumThree } from 'math/addition';
```

We can also rename the named imports:

```javascript
import {
    sumTwo as addTwoNumbers,
    sumThree as sumThreeNumbers
} from 'math/addition';
```

In addition, we can **import all the things** (also called namespace import):

```javascript
import * as util from 'math/addition';
```

Lastly, we can import a list of values from a module:

```javascript
import * as additionUtil from 'math/addition';
const { sumTwo, sumThree } = additionUtil;
```
Importing from the default binding like this:

```javascript
import api from 'math/addition';
// Same as: import { default as api } from 'math/addition';
```

While it is better to keep the exports simple, but we can sometimes mix default import and mixed import if needed.
When we are exporting like this:

```javascript
// foos.js
export { foo as default, foo1, foo2 };
```

We can import them like the following:

```javascript
import foo, { foo1, foo2 } from 'foos';
```

When importing a module exported using commonjs syntax (such as React) we can do:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
const { Component, PropTypes } = React;
```

This can also be simplified further, using:

```javascript
import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';
```

> **Note**: Values that are exported are **bindings**, not references.
Therefore, changing the binding of a variable in one module will affect the
value within the exported module. Avoid changing the public interface of these
exported values.

## Parameters

In ES5, we had varying ways to handle functions which needed **default values**,
**indefinite arguments**, and **named parameters**. With ES6, we can accomplish
all of this and more using more concise syntax.

### Default Parameters

```javascript
function addTwoNumbers(x, y) {
    x = x || 0;
    y = y || 0;
    return x + y;
}
```

In ES6, we can simply supply default values for parameters in a function:

```javascript
function addTwoNumbers(x=0, y=0) {
    return x + y;
}
```

```javascript
addTwoNumbers(2, 4); // 6
addTwoNumbers(2); // 2
addTwoNumbers(); // 0
```

### Rest Parameters

In ES5, we handled an indefinite number of arguments with the `arguments` object:

```javascript
function logArguments() {
    for (var i=0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
        console.log(arguments[i]);
    }
}
```

Using the **rest** operator, we can pass in an indefinite amount of arguments:

```javascript
function logArguments(...args) {
    for (let arg of args) {
        console.log(arg);
    }
}
```

### Named Parameters

One of the patterns in ES5 to handle named parameters was to use the **options
object** pattern, adopted from jQuery.

```javascript
function initializeCanvas(options) {
    var height = options.height || 600;
    var width  = options.width  || 400;
    var lineStroke = options.lineStroke || 'black';
}
```

We can achieve the same functionality using destructuring as a formal parameter
to a function:

```javascript
function initializeCanvas(
    { height=600, width=400, lineStroke='black'}) {
        // Use variables height, width, lineStroke here
    }
```

If we want to make the entire value optional, we can do so by destructuring an
empty object:

```javascript
function initializeCanvas(
    { height=600, width=400, lineStroke='black'} = {}) {
        // ...
    }
```

### Destructured function

You can use destructuring, in conjunction with default values to define different functions succinctly

```javascript
function funcName({destructured = 'optional default value'}, inputVar = 'default value'){
  if(destructured === 'optional default value'){
    console.log("you passed in an object of the form {destructured: 'something'} as the first parameter");
  }else{
    console.log("you did not pass in an object with the destructured value set");
    // or you might have passed in exactly {destructured = 'optional default value', blah, blah, blah}
  }
}
```

### Spread Operator

In ES5, we could find the max of values in an array by using the `apply` method on `Math.max` like this:
```javascript
Math.max.apply(null, [-1, 100, 9001, -32]); // 9001
```

In ES6, we can now use the spread operator to pass an array of values to be used as
parameters to a function:

```javascript
Math.max(...[-1, 100, 9001, -32]); // 9001
```

We can concat array literals easily with this intuitive syntax:

```javascript
let cities = ['San Francisco', 'Los Angeles'];
let places = ['Miami', ...cities, 'Chicago']; // ['Miami', 'San Francisco', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
```

## Classes

Conceptual note: ES6 classes still use prototypal inheritance under the hood. Classes in ES6 do NOT work like classical classes (eg; java classes).

The `new` keyword is applied to a function and binds a new empty object `{}` to the function, replacing it's return type with this new object.

Hence, functions that modify attributes of the `this` object act like constructors when paired with the `new` keyword. A JavaScript class is just a function that sets it's own variables. The traditional ES5 object was a function with
attributes of the prototype set to be the object functions.

All functions in the es6 class are attributes of the `functionName.prototype`, which becomes the `__proto__` of all objects created by this constructor. All static functions in the es6 class are simply placed on the `__proto__` of the constructor functions.

To reiterate: Do not think that ES6 classes are any different from ES5 classes. They just look like they use classical inheritance.

Prior to ES6, we implemented Classes by creating a constructor function and
adding properties by extending the prototype:

```javascript
function Person(name, age, gender) {
    this.name   = name;
    this.age    = age;
    this.gender = gender;
}

Person.prototype.incrementAge = function () {
    return this.age += 1;
};
```

And created extended classes by the following:

```javascript
function Personal(name, age, gender, occupation, hobby) {
    Person.call(this, name, age, gender);
    this.occupation = occupation;
    this.hobby = hobby;
}

Personal.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Personal.prototype.constructor = Personal;
Personal.prototype.incrementAge = function () {
    Person.prototype.incrementAge.call(this);
    this.age += 20;
    console.log(this.age);
};
```

ES6 provides much needed syntactic sugar for doing this under the hood. We can
create Classes directly:

```javascript
class Person {
    constructor(name, age, gender) {
        this.name   = name;
        this.age    = age;
        this.gender = gender;
    }

    incrementAge() {
      this.age += 1;
    }
}
```

And extend them using the `extends` keyword:

```javascript
class Personal extends Person {
    constructor(name, age, gender, occupation, hobby) {
        super(name, age, gender);
        this.occupation = occupation;
        this.hobby = hobby;
    }

    incrementAge() {
        super.incrementAge();
        this.age += 20;
        console.log(this.age);
    }
}
```

> **Best Practice**: While the syntax for creating classes in ES6 obscures how
implementation and prototypes work under the hood, it allows us to write cleaner code.

> **Note**: Private variables are not easily defined in ES6 class constructors. The only way to create a private variable is to define any functions that use the private variables in the constructor. However, this pattern comes with a significant memory tradeoff, since you redefine the function every time you create an object of that class.

```javascript
class Personal extends Person {
    constructor(name, age, gender, occupation, hobby) {
        super(name, age, gender);
        this.hobby = hobby;
        // Occupation is kept private, but this function is re-defined in every child object
        this.getOccupation = ()=>occupation;
    }
}
```

<sup>[(back to table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## Closures

Even after the outer scope has finished execution, the inner scope can still access the outer scope's variables
Note: this is especially relavent to functions, allowing you to create psuedo "private" variables
```javascript
{
    // outer scope
    { 
        // inner scope A
    }

    {
        // inner scope B
    }
}
```
### Advanced concept: Memory management with closures

In JavaScript, accessible memory outside of a block (`{}`) is represented by a dictionary-like refrence object, which will contain a subset of the variables within it's outer lexical scope. JavaScript's dictionary-like scope reference object does not contain a reference to any variables that are NOT used within the inner scope. Hence, even with closures, this allows JavaScript to perform garbage collection on variables in the outer scope once outer scope execution has completed, even if the inner scopes are still referenced in executing code, but the inner scope do not make use of a variable in the outer scope.

An example of this would be in the case of a function that returns a function. Consider the following case:

```javascript
function outer(){
    let a = 1;
    let b = new Array(1000000).join('*');
    return function inner(){
        debugger; // a can be referenced, but b cannot!
        return a;
    }
}
let ref = outer();
```
In the `outer()` function, `outer()`'s execution environment will contain a reference to variables a and b. During outer's execution, a dictionary-like reference object will be created to allow nested code blocks inside of `outer()` (Eg; `inner()`) to access variables in outer. This keeps an in-memory reference to a subset of variables found in `outer()`, preventing garbage collection from deleting variables in the outer scope which we still want to access inside of nested scopes that may be executed later. This is what enables us to use JavaScript closures, accessing variables definined in outer() within inner(), even after outer() has finished executing.

However, consider the memory taken up by variable `b`. It is defined in `outer()`, but is not referenced anywhere within `inner()`. We would much prefer if JavaScript was intelligent enough to garbage collect this variable, which JavaScript does!

JavaScript does this by having the dictionary-like reference object only containing references to variables actually referenced by functions in the inner scopes. In this example, this reference object would contain a reference to `a`, but not to `b`, since `b` is not referenced in `inner`. You can actually verify this, using a debugger to step through the above code. When you add the line `ref();` to call the `inner()` function on the `debugger` line, you will be able to access `a`, but not `b`. Hence, after the execution of `outer()`, there are no remaining references to `b` and it can be automatically garbage collected. (The tradeoff is that within an inner lexical scope, variables in the outer lexical scope are not accessible if they were not reference within the inner scope's code).

Here is when the memory leak occurs: in current JavaScript implementations, the dictionary-like reference object used to access variables in the outer scope is the same object for all inner scopes! Hence, consider the following example:

```javascript
let theThing = null;

function replaceThing() {
    // Outer scope
    var originalThing = theThing;
    function unused() {
        // Inner scope 1
        if (originalThing)
            console.log("hi");
    };
    theThing = {
        // Inner scope 2
        longStr: new Array(1000000).join('*'),
        someMethod: function () {
            console.log(someMessage);
        }
    };
};
setInterval(replaceThing, 1000);
```

Because the dictionary-like reference object is shared by all inner scopes, when `replaceThing` is executed, the code above will result in old `theThing` objects never being garbage collected and more and more memory being taken up every time that `replaceThing` is executed. Hopefully, you can analyse the code above for yourself and understand why this memory leak occurs, but if you get stuck, just keep reading this explaination.

To simplify the following explaination, I will refer to the dictionary-like reference object for inner scopes within replace thing as DictRef.

When replaceThing is executed, the `unused()` function results in `originalThing` being added to DictRef. The new object assigned to `theThing` is an object created within the lexical scope of `replaceThing`. Hence, it references the same DictRef object. After `replaceThing` has finished executing, the DictRef object maintains a reference to `originalThing`. Hence, despite the fact that it is not needed anymore, `originalThing` (The previous `theThing` object) cannot be garbage collected. The DictRef object will remain in memory for as long as a reference to the new `theThing` object exists. This repeats everytime `replaceThing` is called. Each `theThing` object will reference a DictRef object that references the previous version of `theThing`, resulting in an ever growing linked list of closures.

This might be fixed in a future version of JavaScript, but it's something to be aware of for now.

This blurb was inspired by section 4:Closures in this [Medium article](https://blog.meteor.com/an-interesting-kind-of-javascript-memory-leak-8b47d2e7f156).

## Symbols

Symbols have existed prior to ES6, but now we have a public interface to using
them directly. Symbols are immutable and unique and can be used as keys in any hash.

### Symbol( )

Calling `Symbol()` or `Symbol(description)` will create a unique symbol that cannot be looked up
globally. A Use case for `Symbol()` is to patch objects or namespaces from third parties with your own
logic, but be confident that you won't collide with updates to that library. For example,
if you wanted to add a method `refreshComponent` to the `React.Component` class, and be certain that
you didn't trample a method they add in a later update:

```javascript
const refreshComponent = Symbol();

React.Component.prototype[refreshComponent] = () => {
    // do something
}
```


### Symbol.for(key)

`Symbol.for(key)` will create a Symbol that is still immutable and unique, but can be looked up globally.
Two identical calls to `Symbol.for(key)` will return the same Symbol instance. NOTE: This is not true for
`Symbol(description)`:

```javascript
Symbol('foo') === Symbol('foo') // false
Symbol.for('foo') === Symbol('foo') // false
Symbol.for('foo') === Symbol.for('foo') // true
```

A common use case for Symbols, and in particular with `Symbol.for(key)` is for interoperability. This can be
achieved by having your code look for a Symbol member on object arguments from third parties that contain some
known interface. For example:

```javascript
function reader(obj) {
    const specialRead = Symbol.for('specialRead');
    if (obj[specialRead]) {
        const reader = obj[specialRead]();
        // do something with reader
    } else {
        throw new TypeError('object cannot be read');
    }
}
```

And then in another library:

```javascript
const specialRead = Symbol.for('specialRead');

class SomeReadableType {
    [specialRead]() {
        const reader = createSomeReaderFrom(this);
        return reader;
    }
}
```

> A notable example of Symbol use for interoperability is `Symbol.iterator` which exists on all iterable
types in ES6: Arrays, strings, generators, etc. When called as a method it returns an object with an Iterator
interface.

## Maps

**Maps** is a much needed data structure in JavaScript. Prior to ES6, we created
**hash** maps through objects:

```javascript
var map = new Object();
map[key1] = 'value1';
map[key2] = 'value2';
```

However, this does not protect us from accidentally overriding functions with
specific property names:

```javascript
> getOwnProperty({ hasOwnProperty: 'Hah, overwritten'}, 'Pwned');
> TypeError: Property 'hasOwnProperty' is not a function
```

Actual **Maps** allow us to `set`, `get` and `search` for values (and much more).

```javascript
let map = new Map();
> map.set('name', 'david');
> map.get('name'); // david
> map.has('name'); // true
```

The most amazing part of Maps is that we are no longer limited to just using
strings. We can now use any type as a key, and it will not be type-cast to
a string.

```javascript
let map = new Map([
    ['name', 'david'],
    [true, 'false'],
    [1, 'one'],
    [{}, 'object'],
    [function () {}, 'function']
]);

for (let key of map.keys()) {
    console.log(typeof key);
    // > string, boolean, number, object, function
}
```

> **Note**: Using non-primitive values such as functions or objects won't work
when testing equality using methods such as `map.get()`. As such, stick to
primitive values such as Strings, Booleans and Numbers.

We can also iterate over maps using `.entries()`:

```javascript
for (let [key, value] of map.entries()) {
    console.log(key, value);
}
```

<sup>[(back to table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## WeakMaps

In order to store private data versions < ES6, we had various ways of doing this.
One such method was using naming conventions:

```javascript
class Person {
    constructor(age) {
        this._age = age;
    }

    _incrementAge() {
        this._age += 1;
    }
}
```

But naming conventions can cause confusion in a codebase and are not always
going to be upheld. Instead, we can use WeakMaps to store our values:

```javascript
let _age = new WeakMap();
class Person {
    constructor(age) {
        _age.set(this, age);
    }

    incrementAge() {
        let age = _age.get(this) + 1;
        _age.set(this, age);
        if (age > 50) {
            console.log('Midlife crisis');
        }
    }
}
```

The cool thing about using WeakMaps to store our private data is that their
keys do not give away the property names, which can be seen by using
`Reflect.ownKeys()`:

```javascript
> const person = new Person(50);
> person.incrementAge(); // 'Midlife crisis'
> Reflect.ownKeys(person); // []
```

A more practical example of using WeakMaps is to store data which is associated
to a DOM element without having to pollute the DOM itself:

```javascript
let map = new WeakMap();
let el  = document.getElementById('someElement');

// Store a weak reference to the element with a key
map.set(el, 'reference');

// Access the value of the element
let value = map.get(el); // 'reference'

// Remove the reference
el.parentNode.removeChild(el);
el = null;

// map is empty, since the element is destroyed
```

As shown above, once the object is destroyed by the garbage collector,
the WeakMap will automatically remove the key-value pair which was identified
by that object.

> **Note**: To further illustrate the usefulness of this example, consider how
jQuery stores a cache of objects corresponding to DOM elements which have
references. Using WeakMaps, jQuery can automatically free up any memory that
was associated with a particular DOM element once it has been removed from the
document. In general, WeakMaps are very useful for any library that wraps DOM
elements.

<sup>[(back to table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## Promises

Promises allow us to turn our horizontal code (callback hell):

```javascript
func1(function (value1) {
    func2(value1, function (value2) {
        func3(value2, function (value3) {
            func4(value3, function (value4) {
                func5(value4, function (value5) {
                    // Do something with value 5
                });
            });
        });
    });
});
```

Into vertical code:

```javascript
func1(value1)
    .then(func2)
    .then(func3)
    .then(func4)
    .then(func5, value5 => {
        // Do something with value 5
    });
```

Prior to ES6, we used [bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) or
[Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q). Now we have Promises natively:

```javascript
new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
    reject(new Error('Failed to fulfill Promise')))
        .catch(reason => console.log(reason));
```

Where we have two handlers, **resolve** (a function called when the Promise is
**fulfilled**) and **reject** (a function called when the Promise is **rejected**).

> **Benefits of Promises**: Error Handling using a bunch of nested callbacks
can get chaotic. Using Promises, we have a clear path to bubbling errors up
and handling them appropriately. Moreover, the value of a Promise after it has
been resolved/rejected is immutable - it will never change.

Here is a practical example of using Promises:

```javascript
var request = require('request');

return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  request.get(url, (error, response, body) => {
    if (body) {
        resolve(JSON.parse(body));
      } else {
        resolve({});
      }
  });
});
```

We can also **parallelize** Promises to handle an array of asynchronous
operations by using `Promise.all()`:

```javascript
let urls = [
  '/api/commits',
  '/api/issues/opened',
  '/api/issues/assigned',
  '/api/issues/completed',
  '/api/issues/comments',
  '/api/pullrequests'
];

let promises = urls.map((url) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    $.ajax({ url: url })
      .done((data) => {
        resolve(data);
      });
  });
});

Promise.all(promises)
  .then((results) => {
    // Do something with results of all our promises
 });
```

<sup>[(back to table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## Generators

Similar to how [Promises](https://github.com/DrkSephy/es6-cheatsheet#promises) allow us to avoid
[callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/), Generators allow us to flatten our code - giving our
asynchronous code a synchronous feel. Generators are essentially functions which we can
[pause their execution](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/yield)
and subsequently return the value of an expression.

A simple example of using generators is shown below:

```javascript
function* sillyGenerator() {
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield 3;
    yield 4;
}

var generator = sillyGenerator();
> console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
> console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
> console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
> console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 4, done: false }
```

Where [next](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator/next)
will allow us to push our generator forward and evaluate a new expression. While the above example is extremely
contrived, we can utilize Generators to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner:

```javascript
// Hiding asynchronousity with Generators

function request(url) {
    getJSON(url, function(response) {
        generator.next(response);
    });
}
```

And here we write a generator function that will return our data:

```javascript
function* getData() {
    var entry1 = yield request('http://some_api/item1');
    var data1  = JSON.parse(entry1);
    var entry2 = yield request('http://some_api/item2');
    var data2  = JSON.parse(entry2);
}
```

By the power of `yield`, we are guaranteed that `entry1` will have the data needed to be parsed and stored
in `data1`.

While generators allow us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner, there is no clear
and easy path for error propagation. As such, as we can augment our generator with Promises:

```javascript
function request(url) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        getJSON(url, resolve);
    });
}
```

And we write a function which will step through our generator using `next` which in turn will utilize our
`request` method above to yield a Promise:

```javascript
function iterateGenerator(gen) {
    var generator = gen();
    (function iterate(val) {
        var ret = generator.next();
        if(!ret.done) {
            ret.value.then(iterate);
        }
    })();
}
```

By augmenting our Generator with Promises, we have a clear way of propagating errors through the use of our
Promise `.catch` and `reject`. To use our newly augmented Generator, it is as simple as before:

```javascript
iterateGenerator(function* getData() {
    var entry1 = yield request('http://some_api/item1');
    var data1  = JSON.parse(entry1);
    var entry2 = yield request('http://some_api/item2');
    var data2  = JSON.parse(entry2);
});
```

We were able to reuse our implementation to use our Generator as before, which shows their power. While Generators
and Promises allow us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner while retaining the ability to propagate
errors in a nice way, we can actually begin to utilize a simpler construction that provides the same benefits:
[async-await](https://github.com/DrkSephy/es6-cheatsheet#async-await).

<sup>[(back to table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup>

## Async Await

While this is actually an upcoming ES2016 feature, `async await` allows us to perform the same thing we accomplished
using Generators and Promises with less effort:

```javascript
var request = require('request');

function getJSON(url) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    request(url, function(error, response, body) {
      resolve(body);
    });
  });
}

async function main() {
  var data = await getJSON();
  console.log(data); // NOT undefined!
}

main();
```

Under the hood, it performs similarly to Generators. I highly recommend using them over Generators + Promises. A great resource
for getting up and running with ES7 and Babel can be found [here](http://masnun.com/2015/11/11/using-es7-asyncawait-today-with-babel.html).

<sup>[(back to table of contents)](#table-of-contents)</sup>
## Getter and setter functions

ES6 has started supporting getter and setter functions within classes. Using the following example:

```javascript
class Employee {

    constructor(name) {
        this._name = name;
    }

    get name() {
      if(this._name) {
        return 'Mr. ' + this._name.toUpperCase();  
      } else {
        return undefined;
      }  
    }

    set name(newName) {
      if (newName == this._name) {
        console.log('I already have this name.');
      } else if (newName) {
        this._name = newName;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    }
}

var emp = new Employee("James Bond");

// uses the get method in the background
if (emp.name) {
  console.log(emp.name);  // Mr. JAMES BOND
}

// uses the setter in the background
emp.name = "Bond 007";
console.log(emp.name);  // Mr. BOND 007  
```

Latest browsers are also supporting getter/setter functions in Objects and we can use them for computed properties, adding listeners and preprocessing before setting/getting:

```javascript
var person = {
  firstName: 'James',
  lastName: 'Bond',
  get fullName() {
      console.log('Getting FullName');
      return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
  },
  set fullName (name) {
      console.log('Setting FullName');
      var words = name.toString().split(' ');
      this.firstName = words[0] || '';
      this.lastName = words[1] || '';
  }
}

person.fullName; // James Bond
person.fullName = 'Bond 007';
person.fullName; // Bond 007
```

## Regex

```
/regex/ - matches any string containing 'regex' as a substring
/regex$/ - matches any string ending with 'regex'
/^regex/ - matches any string starting with regex
/r*egex/ - matches egex, preceded by any number of r characters
/r+egex/ - matches egex, preceded by any 1 or more x characters
/r?egex/ - matches egex or regex
/r{n,m}egex/ - n and m are numbers - matches egex, preceded by between n to m copies of r
/[^regex]/ - any string that does NOT contain regex
/reg|ex/ - matches any string containing either reg or ex
```
